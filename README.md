Then coming to past experience as QA Automation Engineer in **Dell Technologies** and  a Java Club member in my school and experience has an QA Automation Engineer	 in **Newmark**  has evloved me in increasing my ability to Set my Career in Java Developement and Curiosity in Tesing.

With a strong passion for development and testing, I've pursued certifications like Web Designing early in my career and following with Selenium Testing from advance to frameworks to enhance my knowledge and skills in these areas. You can view my [certifications](Certification.md#Certification)


Beyond the tech world, I love memes, dogs, mountains, sunsets and contemplating life at ungodly hours. I like to think of myself as a blend of tech-savvy and a lover of life's little quirks.
